              Amsterdam, Netherlands. I had the oppurtunity to <br />

              the canals and friendly culutre Holland has to offer.

              Dublin, Ireland. On my way over to Amsterdam I had <br />
              a layover in Dublin so I had a few hours to explore <br />
              the city and grab some pints in the local pubs.

              Dubai, UAE. I have traveled to Dubai with some family <br />
              friends that used to live there. I got to experience <br />
              the great arabic culture as well as many others Dubai has <br />
              to offer. One of my goals is to move here!.

              my friend who is from Tel Aviv so I was able to go <br />
              out with him and meet many great friends going out. <br />
              I also had the chance to visit the holy city of Jersualem.
